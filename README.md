# JS Cards

## Motivation

The point of this project is to fill the gap between learning grammar rules and committing them to memory.

It's also because I really like grammar rules, even though I'm terrible at languages. I want to be a bit better at languages.

People say you should throw away your grammar books and just practice the language. Which is fine, and they're probably right, but when I form mnemonics, I really, really like when they are actually based on the actual
rules that underly the language. I have my neverending set of flashcards, but it would be nicer if I
could just remember that darn rule of how to make plurals in Swedish.


## Program Overview

1. Enter a list of example words that follow the same rules.
2. Try formulating a rule to save you from typing.
3. Edit the results to account for exceptions to the rule.
4. Repeat with other sets of words (not done yet).
5. Practice those words.
6. At the end of each practice, you'll see your results and see which rules/examples/exceptions you need to focus on.


## History

I started writing this to learn Haskell. But I wanted to actually start using it, so I rewrote it using JavaScript and d3.
